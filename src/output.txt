		 
Thank you for agreeing to help. My son is in a difficult position.		 
But this is the only thing that's made the last three years bearable.		 
You're too good for this world.		 
Is there something you want to tell me, son?		 
If we both stick to the story, they can't prove anything.		 
If only I'd just gone over when she called.		 
Midnight, on the bridge. Come alone.		 
Go and live with her, then! See if I care.		 
What do you remember about your mother?		 
We can't. I'm your boss.		 
Could you be happy here with me?		 
Give me one good reason why I should wear a dress.		 
She doesn't understand you like I do.		 
Tell me what you saw, for her sake!		 
I'm telling you - the guy was a complete stranger, just walked up and gave me the bag.		 
You have his eyes.		 
Go and live with her, then! See if I care.		 
Oh yeah, you really told him, didn't you?		 
I have to do something to help that child.		 
The way you flirt is shameful.		 
I hope that what I've said hasn't hurt you too much.		 
Would you come to my funeral?		 
You've only heard his point of view. You never asked mine.		 
I don't think I could live alone again.		 
I have to do something to help that child.		 
Have you read the newspaper stories about my wife?		 
Whatever you're going to ask, the answer is No!		 
This isn't just about you. It's about what's best for all of us.		 
Why didn't he come and talk to me himself?		 
She's old and it's about time she died.		 
Sorry, its just that I get very nervous when someone else is driving.		 
Please don't argue. You have to leave right now, you aren't safe here.		 
Just give me my cut of the money and I'll be out of here.		 
Why did you scream like that?		 
How, exactly, did you think that having an affair would help our marriage?		 
Promise me you'll look after your mother.		 
He couldn't have died at a worse time.		 
I'm too old to start again.		 
What do you remember about your mother?		 
Spare some change, please?		 
Don't be scared. I just need you to come with me for a minute.		 
I knew you wouldn't be able to see it through.		 
What do you remember about your mother?		 
I've forgotten what it's like to feel young.		 
Is there something you want to tell me, son?		 
You've taken her back? You can't be serious?		 
Sorry, its just that I get very nervous when someone else is driving.		 
Oh yeah, you really told him, didn't you?		 
Try focussing more on your life and less on mine!		 
You stand there and accuse me, but where were you at the time?		 
I have to do something to help that child.		 
I've been waiting a long time for you.		 
There's a surprise for you in the garage.		 
She doesn't understand you like I do.		 
Why did you scream like that?		 
Why did you scream like that?		 
I did a pregnancy test.		 
It looks like you're in trouble there. Can I help?		 
I don't think I could live alone again.		 
If you do this, you will be dead to me.		 
How dare you look down your nose at me like that.		 
I thought someone should tell you that your mother has died.		 
You're too good for this world.		 
Try focussing more on your life and less on mine!		 
I miss moments like this more than anything.		 
If you leave now, you lose everything.		 
You don't want to live in a society like this, yet you don't want to do anything about it!		 
I have to do something to help that child.		 
I did a pregnancy test.		 
Well? What happened? I want all the details!		 
We can't. I'm your boss.		 
Do you ever think we should just stop doing this?		 
You came back!		 
Am I supposed to be scared now?		 
You were always the quiet one.		 
Don't be scared. I just need you to come with me for a minute.		 
Oh my God. You're in love with her.		 
I daren't stay long. I just had to see you.		 
I miss moments like this more than anything.		 
What do you mean, he's escaped?		 
Perhaps you'll take me out one day - or do I have to make an appointment?		 
I'm too old to start again.		 
I've been checking you out.		 
I never meant to come between you and him.		 
What have you done with my pills? I need them!		 
I'm your daughter.		 
I did a pregnancy test.		 
Have you read the newspaper stories about my wife?		 
You don't want to live in a society like this, yet you don't want to do anything about it!		 
She's old and it's about time she died.		 
Please don't argue. You have to leave right now, you aren't safe here.		 
I hope that what I've said hasn't hurt you too much.		 
But this is the only thing that's made the last three years bearable.		 
Quick, hide behind the sofa!		 
Could you be happy here with me?		 
I WILL find out who killed my husband, with or without your help.		 
How, exactly, did you think that having an affair would help our marriage?		 
Thank you for agreeing to help. My son is in a difficult position.		 
I WILL find out who killed my husband, with or without your help.		 
Sorry, its just that I get very nervous when someone else is driving.		 
Find some proof that she's betrayed you.		 
Sweetheart, what did you bury in the garden?		 
Spare some change, please?		 
Have you read the newspaper stories about my wife?		 
You're paying a small price compared with what she's going through.		 
I'm too old to start again.		 
I want to turn back the clock to before...		 
Are you kidding me? We're not 'fine'!		 
Quick, hide behind the sofa!		 
I'm your daughter.		 
He was unconscious when I found him		 
I'm sorry if it upsets you, but I'm going to marry her.		 
How dare you look down your nose at me like that.		 
You don't think that was just lemonade in your glass, do you?		 
What do you mean, you've lost the lottery ticket?		 
For some reason, I'm attracted to you.		 
You have his eyes.		 
H-how long have you been standing there?		 
Where does a child hide in a small town like this?		 
Sorry, its just that I get very nervous when someone else is driving.		 
I dread the sound of his key in the lock.		 
I don't often get the chance to talk to someone like you.		 
She's been missing since Friday and you're not worried?		 
I have to do something to help that child.		 
You were meant to be watching him!		 
Do you ever think we should just stop doing this?		 
Whatever you're going to ask, the answer is No!		 
If you do this, you will be dead to me.		 
Oh my God. You're in love with her.		 
You stand there and accuse me, but where were you at the time?		 
There's someone in the house!		 
Oh my God. You're in love with her.		 
You came back!		 
For some reason, I'm attracted to you.		 
If only I'd just gone over when she called.		 
Do you ever think we should just stop doing this?		 
I never meant to come between you and him.		 
I daren't stay long. I just had to see you.		 
If we both stick to the story, they can't prove anything.		 
Am I under arrest, or not?		 
I want that woman out of my house!		 
How could I abandon my children?		 
Have you read the newspaper stories about my wife?		 
Tell me what you saw, for her sake!		 
You've only heard his point of view. You never asked mine.		 
Thank you for agreeing to help. My son is in a difficult position.		 
Did you enjoy yourself last night?		 
I don't often get the chance to talk to someone like you.		 
H-how long have you been standing there?		 
I don't often get the chance to talk to someone like you.		 
This isn't just about you. It's about what's best for all of us.		 
You make me feel like I'm not good enough.		 
You stand there and accuse me, but where were you at the time?		 
You were always the quiet one.		 
She doesn't understand you like I do.		 
Whatever you're going to ask, the answer is No!		 
Does he know about the baby?		 
If you leave now, you get nothing.		 
Please don't argue. You have to leave right now, you aren't safe here.		 
I want to turn back the clock to before...		 
What's in that bag and why are you hiding it here?		 
Tell me what you saw, for her sake!		 
I'm sorry if it upsets you, but I'm going to marry her.		 
You must find it before the others do.		 
You've taken her back? You can't be serious?		 
You must be mad, coming here like this.		 
If you leave now, you get nothing.		 
Please don't argue. You have to leave right now, you aren't safe here.		 
I've been checking you out.		 
H-how long have you been standing there?		 
You think I'm being paranoid but the truth is I'm worth a lot more to her dead than alive.		 
I'm your daughter.		 
For some reason, I'm attracted to you.		 
I'm telling you - the guy was a complete stranger, just walked up and gave me the bag.		 
Promise me you'll look after your mother.		 
No! I'm tired of doing what you say.		 
You had time to call the police. Why didn't you?		 
There's a surprise for you in the garage.		 
She doesn't understand you like I do.		 
If you get me his phone, I might reconsider.		 
I''m not really surprised that you murdered him.		 
I've forgotten what it's like to feel young.		 
There's a surprise for you in the garage.		 
Is there something you want to tell me, son?		 
I've been waiting a long time for you.		 
What a thing to say - and on my birthday!		 
Am I supposed to be scared now?		 
I daren't stay long. I just had to see you.		 
You have his eyes.		 
What's in that bag and why are you hiding it here?		 
Try focussing more on your life and less on mine!		 
If only I'd just gone over when she called.

You don't want to live in a society like this, yet you don't want to do anything about it!		 
Would you come to my funeral?		 
What do you remember about your mother?		 
You've only heard his point of view. You never asked mine.		 
Are you taking his side against me?Anaria Shola.

Everything has a price.
Mind yourself.
You waste my time.
I had little patience to begin with!
Not very intelligent, are you?
Ah, you have a death wish.
Why do you linger?
Run away pest!
These are dark times indeed.
I do not suffer fools easily.
Light. Must remember the Light.

Shadows gather.
This curse has not broken me yet. 
A dark wind is blowing.
What are we without the sky?
Keep to the shadows!
The Talon King will guide us.
Beware the burning sky.
Tread carefully.
Oh great, now I'm molting. Happy with yourself?
We press on!

Ashes to Ashes.
We will ravage this land!
We will have our revenge!
We are done here!
Leave me be!
Another time...
Tomorrow is another day.
There's work to be done.
My torture continues!
There is no escape...
You'll find it difficult to speak, without a head.
Just walk away...
You lost me at hello.
I have sacrificed everything. What have you given?
We are all that stands between the Legion and annihilation.
Azeroth must not fall.
My life is dedicated to destroying the Burning Legion.
Lord Illidan knows the way.
Remember, nothing is more important than the Legion's destruction.
Do not give in to the power of the Legion.
Trust in Lord Illidan's plan.
If we do not meet again... die well.
Death to the Legion.
Did you just touch me?
I wouldn't if I were you.
Normally I hunt demons but for you I'll make an exception.
Do it again and your skull will be my whetstone.
You're no demon, but I will put you in the ground just the same.
I will feast on your soul!
Blessings upon you.

You behave like a child!
You have other matters to attend to yes?
Who taught you act like this!?
Do you require medication?
Does this amuse yourself!?
Even the patience of the Draenei has its limits...
The Naaru frown on such behavior...
You are not normal.

Ah, bad luck to keep poking Grummle, very, very bad luck!
 You smell too good to be lucky!

 You seek the wisdom of a Grummle?!
 It is good fortune to give money to a Grummle!
 Ah! A foot rub! Also very good luck!

Hello there.
Greetings.
Light be with you.
What can I do for you?
Well met.
Need help?
King's honor, friend.
You need somethin'?
Can I help you?
How are you?
Hey there.
Hello.
Good day to you.
Farewell.
Be careful.
Go with honor, friend.
Safe travels!
For the Alliance.
See you around.
Light bless you.
Have a good one.
I supply only the finest goods.
What are you looking for?
What can I help you with?
I buy and trade.
Looking for something specific?
Forget something?
What's your problem?
Knock it off...
Quit it
I'm Kinda busy.
You're getting on my nerves.
What is it?
More work?
What?
D'oh!
Orders commander?
What are your orders?
Good to see you commander
Commander?
All's quiet commander.
Greetings.
Which river led you here?
Do you hear the river's song?
Go with the waters.
May your feet never dry.
May the currents be strong.
Farewell.
It is said: Never swim upstream, when downstream are the hozen.
 You smell fish?
The waters foretold of this meeting.
Water is life.
Do you hear the river's song?
Listen to the river.
The river speaks of your deeds.
Do not be afraid to swim against the current.
May your pools be ever full.
Go with the waters.
Farewell.
The river goes where the river wills.
The pandaren are wise. The hozen... not so much.
There is wisdom in the water. Other things too, but mostly wisdom.
You are far from home.
Speak.
Yes, Wakener?
We are done.
Preserve the cycle.
The will of the Klaxxi is eternal.
You are not part of the cycle!
Now you're just being... mean!
You are not welcome here.
SERIOUSLY, STOP IT!
No, I am not crying, my nasal cranial ducts are secreting excess mucus from my lacrimal sacs. It's perfectly normal!
Buy, sell!
You seek to trade?
Do you have something of value?
How can I aid you, little one?
Let's make this quick.
I wouldn't call what I do 'serving' the Illidari. It's more like... cooperation.
What is it now?
I'm busy, but I can make time for you.
Well, at least this place beats Outland... Any place beats Outland.
Fight well, slay many demons, try not to die.
Lord Illidan is the one true master of the Illidari.
Is that all?
Zin-Azshari, adore.
Are you fishing for compliments?
Don't be so shallow.
You are not giving me a leg to stand on here.
I think we need to scale back our relationship.
How long would you say you can hold your breath? I'm just asking... for a friend.
In the depths, no one can hear you scream... Well, they can, but it's really muffled.
Tanu'balah.
Wisdom to Elisande.

Our destiny is at hand.
We no longer hide.

Suramar is still a shining jewel, in the rubble of the Sundering.
We will explore the rest of the world and show them that we are still relevant.
I bought it from the scout patrol he called it a  [S.E.L.F.I.E. Camera]. Any idea what it is?

How about you go bug someone else for a while.
Look, I just wanna finish my shift, and usher in a new era for Azeroth.
Can you let me do that? Will you let me do my ushering?
I should have taken that post in Azshara.
Wow, you're tall.
Do you want some magic juice? I'm full.

Weren't you leaving?
Have you nothing better to do?
Enough already.
Begone!
Stop this nonsense.
You won't like when I angry.
We are cursed to spend eternity as ghosts.
Yes?
We were betrayed by our prince.
Azsuna was once beautiful, ten thousand years ago.
Farondis should never have opposed Queen Azshara.
I'm a ghost, genius. You can't touch me.
You can stop any time now.
That really is getting annoying.
I have all eternity to get my revenge.
Boo! Hahaha.

Looking to buy?
Buy something.
You will not find a better bargain.
You move like a pregnant yak!
Your so-called Kung Fu is really quite pathetic.
Your swordsmanship is amateur at best!
So my pathetic friend... is there anything that you can do well?!
I knew it! All you are good at is ordering food at restaurants and spending your guild's money. Get out of my sight!
or
It is said: Wise man do not poke bear.
Are you spoiling for a fight?

I have travelled far to assemble these goods.

We can do business.
You are in for a treat!
Looking to buy?
My goods are crafted with great care.
So... you like to play games?
I will you teach you my favourite Pandaren game to play.
It is called Touch me again and I will kick your face.
It is a fun game... because I always win.
Is there not something more productive you could do with your hands?
Perhaps you should get a hobby.
Have you seen the sights of Pandaria?
The Serpent's Spine is a wall that travels the length of the continent, and was originally built during the Mogu dynasties.
The Veiled Stair is a hidden pass connecting the Valley of Four Winds to the Northern Highlands. There is a tavern there that I highly recommend.
On the southern shores you will find Turtle Beach, where the first Pandaren explorer ventured into the ocean on the back of a turtle... or so the legend goes.
Mount Neverest in Kun-Lai Summit is the tallest peak in Pandaria... perhaps in the whole world!
What I am trying to say is... please, just go bother someone else!
What wisdom do you seek?
Tell me of your travels.
You are most welcome.
You have the eyes of one who has travelled much.
Family. Friends. Food. These are what matter most.
May you find mastery in your passions.
Slow down! Life is to be savoured!
May the Red Crane live forever in your heart.
I am too old for this.
We never treated our elders such, when I was a cub!
What wisdom do you seek?
Tell me of your travels.
You are most welcome.

The world is your teacher.
Spirits bless your path.
Live for your dreams.
These are the finest goods in the land.
You have come to the right place.
Behold the wonders of Pandaria.
I am too old for this.
We never treated our elders such, when I was a cub!
Where are you from?
Hi there!
I'm growing a beard!
What'cha doin'?
Who are you supposed to be?
You're fun!
Come back soon!
Tell me a story before you go?
Where you going?
Bye bye!
Where do turtles come from?
I like climbing trees.
Did you ever eat a bug?
Watch what I can do with my lips! 
You've sure got a lot of questions.
OK... you're weird.
Tell me a story!
I'm not afraid of you!
Hi there!
Where are you from?
Some day I'm going to be a hero, like you!
Go smash some bad guys!
Have fun!
See you later!
Bye bye!
Where are you going?
I'm smarter than you! I'm clever like a Jinyu!
You sure do talk a lot.
I can burp - watch! ... Wait for it...
 Did you hear it?! That was me!
OK... yeah... bored.
Now you're just being creepy.
We are the sword in the shadows.
We must not falter.
We are the watchers on the wall.
What is it?
Pandaria conceals a great darkness
We serve so others do not have to.
Watch the shadows.
The wall must stand.
Beware the western wind.
There are better ways to get my attention.
Were you sent here to test me?!
I have trained my entire life to keep my emotions in check, but then you come along, with your poking, and your prodding! ... Inner calm... must maintain inner calm...
We are the sword in the shadows.
We are the watchers on the wall.
We keep the darkness at bay.
Our vigil is constant.
Speak.
The wall must stand.
Stay vigilant.
Be strong.
Move like the night.
You will not break my resolve.
You will...  not... break... my resolve.
 So help me... I will break your resolve!
Now what?
You again?
Don't touch me!
Well, hello there.
I'd sooner kill you than look at you, but let's start with look.
Your wish might be my command. Then again...
Yes, I am on your side. It's complicated, because... reasons.
I live to serve the Illidari.
No hug before you go?
Next time, eyes all the way up here.
Let's do this again real soon.
I always love our little chats.
Try not to forget that the Legion wants to burn all worlds, especially yours.
Oh, no you did not!
Well, this is wholly inappropriate! I'm hardly dressed for a poking war.
Hey, that one hurt! I don't take pain, I deliver it.
I'm starting to think that I need to put you over my knee! A six-arm spanking is in order.
ENOUGH! [Unintelligible Eredun cursing]
Peace friend.

Have you come to trade?
Are you staring at my rack?
Want a closer look? HEADBUTT!
It's a long way to fall off this mountain.
This rack isn't just for show, you know.

You have use of these things.
Are you staying long?
This is... amusing to you?
My people have twenty words for the sea.
But we have none to describe your behavior.
Zzzzz... wha? You were saying something?
Your disposition is... fishy.
I spit on you!
Out with it!
You come to die!
Sniveling pig!
And don't come back!
You are wise to depart!
Out way!
Begone.
Take it or leave it.

Ain't you a chipper looking one?
We've been walled up for far too long.
Oi!
Any friend of Greymane is a friend of mine.
I've got a bad feeling.
Get gabbing or get going.
What can I do for you?
What's your story?
Yes?
Greymane will lead us to victory.
You have my attention.
Our curse grants us strength.
Hail traveler.

No time for dallying.
You have my undivided attention.
Glory to Gilneas.
Gilneas will be reborn from the blood of our enemies.
Watch your back!
Long live Greymane.
Farewell.
Good day.
Keep your chin up, eh?
That's enough gabbing from me today.
Let the light of the new moon guide you.
We are bound by a common enemy.
You wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry.
The past must not be repeated.
We are not the monsters here.
Keep your enemies in your sights.
We must face our fears.
Remember that the beasts in the shadows might be your salvation.

You dare challenge me?
Get lost!
I grow tired of you.
