#Contibuting to Off

## Welcome contributors to the project: 
Off is a text-based rpg game on the messaging client Slack. We invite anyone to look at and contribute to our project. We would be grateful for any contributions and advise you are willing to give.
## Testing
We tested our game ourselves, trying to find different bugs in the game. It is very helpful to edit the code during testing, so you can advance to higher levels faster. Testing might feel tedious, but remeber that the game is supposed to be fun.
## Development environment details
This project was created during HackIllinois 2017. We created this because we really enjoyed the idea of having an RPG in Slack.

## How to submit changes: Pull Request protocol etc. 
We will review your pull requests and contact you before accepting them. It would be best for your interests to fork this project when you work on it. We ask you to give proper recognition if you do use our model.

## How to report a bug: 
* If you find a bug, we would like you to include the details of the issue on a GitHub Issues.
* First bugs for Contributors
  * If adding more items, weapons, and armor you might notice that the JSON text is automatically lowercased when put into the Firebase database.
  * There might be some null values in our Markov Chains, we worked around this, but were not able to fix it.
    
## New Feature Requirements
The feature should fit into the themes of our game. The formatting of JSON and the scheme of our database should not dramatically change. Please do not touch our Markov Chians, they are intentionally bad to fit with our theme. Overall, just have fun with working on this project, because that is it's purpose.

## Style Guide / Coding conventions 
New commands should be added with using the current conventions we have implemented into bot.py.
All items should be kept in items.JSON, but seperated by the specific type of items.  Similarly, all the enemies should be kept in enemies.JSON, where they are seperated 

## Code of Conduct
Refrain from using too much explicit content. Please be patient with our team, we are students, meaning we don't have time.

## Recognition model
We would all like to be forever immortalized as items, NPCs, and enemies in future versions of the game.
To be formally recognized, link back to this GitHub Project.

## Where can I ask for help?
If you need help, please post a question to GitHub Issues.
